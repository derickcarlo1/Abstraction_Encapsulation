# Fan OOP 🖥️

## Introduction 📢
This repository contains a program that simulates a Fan class in Python. The Fan class represents a fan with attributes such as speed, radius, color, and on/off state. The program allows you to create instances of the Fan class and manipulate their attributes.

## Features 🗃️
- Create instances of the Fan class with customizable attributes.
- Set and get the speed, radius, color, and on/off state of a fan.
- Demonstrate the usage of the Fan class methods.

## How to Run 📝
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher).
3. Install the necessary dependencies, if any.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
5. Run the program by executing the following command:
    ```
    python program.py
    ```
6. The program will run and demonstrate the usage of the Fan class methods.

## Language Used 📌
The program is written in Python, a popular and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python provides an object-oriented approach that makes it suitable for creating classes and objects.

## Purpose 💡
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the concept of object-oriented programming in Python through the implementation of the Fan class. It serves as an educational example to understand the usage of classes, attributes, and methods in Python.
