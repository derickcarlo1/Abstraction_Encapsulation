# Pet Information System (OOP) 
- Welcome to the Pet Information System repository! This repository contains two Python programs: class_pet.py and test_pet.py, which allow users to store and retrieve information about their pets.

## Introduction
- The Pet Information System is designed to provide a simple and interactive way to store and display information about pets. It consists of a class named Pet that encapsulates pet data and provides methods to set and get pet information. The test_pet.py program demonstrates how to use the Pet class to create pet objects and interact with them.

## Features
- Create a pet object and store information such as name, animal type, and age.
- Retrieve and display the stored pet information.

## Language Used
- The Pet Information System is implemented in Python, a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language. Python provides object-oriented capabilities, which are utilized in the Pet class to encapsulate and manipulate pet data.

## How to Run
### To run the Pet Information System programs, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3 or above).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory.
4. To run the class_pet.py program, execute the following command: 'python class_pet.py'
This program will prompt you to enter the pet's information and display it on the screen.
5. To run the test_pet.py program, execute the following command: 'python test_pet.py'
This program will demonstrate the usage of the Pet class by setting predefined pet information and displaying it on the screen.
