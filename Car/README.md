# Car OOP 🚘
Welcome to the Car Speed Test repository! This repository contains a Python program that simulates a car's speed using the `Car` class. It demonstrates the concepts of object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Features 🔗

- Create a `Car` object with year model and make attributes
- Accelerate the car's speed by 5 units
- Brake the car's speed by 5 units
- Get the current speed of the car

## How to Run 💻

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or above).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files as a ZIP archive.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to execute the `testcar.py` program:

    ```bash
    python cartest.py
    ```

5. The program will display the Car Speed Test header and output the car's speed after accelerating and braking.

## Language Used 📚

This program is written in Python, a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python's object-oriented capabilities make it suitable for implementing classes and creating objects.

## Purpose ❓

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the usage of classes, encapsulation, and abstraction in Python. It provides a basic example of modeling a car's speed and controlling its acceleration and braking. The code structure showcases the principles of object-oriented programming and highlights the benefits of encapsulating data within class methods.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different values, and expand upon it to suit your needs!
